# MSDA Portfolio  
This is a portfolio of the work completed by Bernard Connelly during my Master's Degree program at Western Governors University between July 2024 and July 2025. This repository includes summaries, reports, Jupyter Notebooks, and hyperlinks to Dashboards & Panopto Videos of each Performance Assessment required for the degree. My completion of these bridged between the old MSDA program and the new MSDA program. There was some overlap with the old to the new, but the new program had additional courses, assessments, and projects to complete. You can differentiate the new vs. old program based on whether they were a 200 (old) or 600 (new) course number.

## Background & Journey
As a former behavior analyst, I have always enjoyed diving into and digging through data; however, this degree program was the most significant step I took to move into this realm fully. I completed the program in one year with a substantial amount of dedication and hard work for each class and assessment. Going into this, I had zero Python and Tableau experience, and intermediate SQL experience through my previous employer - mostly tinkering with developed queries or doing basic data pulls from the HR data. Pushing through these classes was extremely rewarding to push the limits of my understanding and growth in each subject - including putting long hours in on Stack Overflow, Google, and various subreddits to learn different ways to complete the unique problems presented in Data Analytics. 

## Courses & Timeline
I aimed to complete this program fairly casually in 3 semesters. I took a break for most of December 2024 since the program would switch over with the new year, and another ~3-week break in May surrounding family issues. Once I got into the new program with the more technical projects and data science focus, I found that my desire to complete it remained steady, and I pushed to complete it within 2 semesters. It took me about a year and a week to complete.
